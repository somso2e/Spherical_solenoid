Calculating the magnetic field caused by a spherical solenoid using MATLAB and implementing a GUI using MATLAB App Desginer.
## How to use
Use ```appdesigner(Spherical_solenoid.mlapp)``` in MATLAB command window to run the GUI.

Plots are pre-calculated using  ```drawSolenoidShapeXY``` or ```drawSolenoidShapeYZ``` and the values are saved as *.mat files.

**WARNING: Those two scripts use parallel computation and still each may take up to an hour to complete depending on your CPU.**
